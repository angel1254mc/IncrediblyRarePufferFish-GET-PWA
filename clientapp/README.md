# GET PWA Client WebApp / PWA

### This is the client webapp for the GET Proof Of Concept ###
<hr></hr>

<p> This is the Proof Of Concept / Prototype for the GET WebApp & PWA. It uses MongoDB Search indexing to find the closest result to what the user is searching for. In the future, I'll try to implement dynamic page routing for each term, containing more information as well as reference links to each of the terms. One of the biggest uncertainties right now is setting up the Service Worker and PWA functionality, so I'll try to get to that as soon as I can </p>
